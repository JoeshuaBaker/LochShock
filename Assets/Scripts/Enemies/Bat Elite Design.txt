path bezier curve
boid cloud around interpolating point along path
scaleable number of bats
hover around a point in a radius around the path point
if bats get too far away their next point goes behind player somewhere
drop aoe damage
each bat contributes to a attack charge bar while alive
bats can spend small charge amount to do a arcing projectile (???) attack (just a danger zone)
when bar gets too full, big coordinated attack (same thing as small but faster over greater area)
kills basic enemies, but no touch damage on player
